# tic-tac-toe
This project implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, allowing a human player to play against the computer. The game checks for: inning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), tie conditions, valid player moves
The computer selects moves randomly, and the game continues until there is a winner or a tie.

## setup instructions
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Ensure there is a plain text file called output.txt in the same directory as the code. This file is used to display previous winners or scores.
3. Run the Python script
   python tic_tac_toe.py
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to place your moves by entering numbers 1–9 corresponding to board positions.
